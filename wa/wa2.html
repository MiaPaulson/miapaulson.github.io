        <h2>Little bit about me...</h2>
        <p>I am a sophomore at CU Boulder, majoring in creative technology and design engineering and minoring in both space and data science.</p>
        <p>I love being outdoors! Camping, hiking, and fishing are some of my favorite things to do,</p>
        <p>even if my day of fishing looks like having others fish and me enjoying a good book :)</p>
        <p>Country and folk music are my jam, and I love going to concerts (Caamp at Red Rocks was amazinggg)!</p>
        <h3>Course Goals</h3>
        <p>Web design is the main thing that draws me to my major.</p>
        <p>My goal is to really understand web development, hopefully even get pretty good at it, and deduce if I really want to make a career out of web development and design!</p>
