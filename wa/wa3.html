        <p>The Pixar Theory was created by Jon Negroni when he wrote his book, the Pixar Theory.
            The Theory is centered on one thing: all pixar movies exist on the same timeline and in the same universe.
            This premise explains the many eastereggs connecting the movies, the never-ending symbolism, and also the magical connection each movie has.
            Don't believe me? Read the book... or get a basic understanding from this page... and trust me, you'll understand.

        <h3>More info not written by me</h3>
        <p>
            I can't go into too much depth myself, but if you want to know more, here's a <a href = "https://fantheories.fandom.com/wiki/The_Pixar_Theory#Buy-n-Large">Fanpage</a>
        </p>


        <h2 id = "timeline">Timeline</h2>
        <p>
            The Pixar Theory timeline begins with <em>A Good Dinosaur</em> and ends with <em>Monsters Inc.</em> The best part? This final movie is one of the most important for the universe, along with the second movie in our timeline, <em>Brave.</em>
            The timeline does not only go through a significant amount of time, but it also lasts longer than humans even do (ever seen WALL-E?).

        <p>
            This company is a significant tie to the entire Pixar universe. They basically monopolize the whole world, proving "energy" for humans and toys alike.
            The BNL logo shows up in multiple different movies, but is never directly talked about or named. That shows just how big of a deal they are - they don't even need a callout for everyone to know they are there.
            BNL is a major connection between movies, since they are trying to control the whole universe, and their reign spans across movies in small details with big impacts.

            Everything needs humans to survive. <em>Toy Story</em> is a great example of this, as Andy's toys are alive because of the love Andy shows for them.
            This aspect of the theory is very important, as it explains why the monsters in <em>Monsters Inc.</em> get scream energy from what?? You got it - humans!
        </p>

        <p>
            In the timeline, you can see that a lot of movies occur after humans are dead. But how?
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Cars</em> is actually dated, with these dates mentioned, in the 1950s. However, they only think that is what the year is, because they are alive and running "on their own" by being fueled by their previous owners' memories!
            Lighting McQueen's previous owner was a cocky racecar driver, Doc was a grumpy old race car driver, etc. Pretty cool, right?
            But the biggest human connection is in <em>Monsters Inc.</em> At this point, there are no humans left, only monsters. However, they need humans to survive, as with every other Pixar movie. So, what do they do?
            They create doors that go BACK IN TIME to get the screams (literally their energy source) from humans (literally the only way to survive). Wacky, huh? But still pretty epic.

        <h2 id = "boo">Boo</h2>
        <p>
            By far the COOLEST part of the Pixar Theory, and honestly its very FOUNDATION, is Boo.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a child, she goes on quite a wild ride... meeting Sully, who as far as she is concered is a huge, colorful bear; becoming friends with Mike; defeating Randall; you name it.
            How could she just go back to living a normal life?
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll tell you how: <em>She didn't.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            She spent her entire life looking for Sully, her big bear-like friend. She figured that since she had never seen anything like him in her lifetime, that he was from a very different time.
            Naturally, since she's super cool, she gets good at witchcraft and finds a way to time travel to find him. However, instead of going forward in time where Sully actually lives, she goes <em>back.</em>
        </p>
        <h3>Biggest Connector!!!</h3>
        <p>
            How do I know this, you ask? Easy. BOO IS THE WITCH FROM BRAVE. It explains her obsession with bears. Her constant absences in the movie are from her looking for her friend.
            And, it connects each side of the timeline: two movies, two plotlines, secretly one character. Now that, I have to say, is pretty epic.
        </p>
