**Hi!** My name is Mia Paulson, and this is my repo for my Web class. Here, all of my projects and the beginnings of my very own really cool resume will live!

_A few fun facts about me:_ I love country and folk music, going on hikes, dancing with my friends, and reading in my free time. I am definitely a certified nerd, but am not against going out of my comfort zone and being my extroverted self!
