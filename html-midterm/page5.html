    <h1>Good Old Errors</h1>

    <h2>Page 1</h2>
    <h3>We are told there are 5 errors with HTML code</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Item 3 did not have a closing tag for li, so I added the closing tag with /li.</li>
        <li>The paragraph also did not have a closing p tag, so I added the closing tag /p</li>
        <li>Cell 3 in tag td did not have a closer, so I added the /td tag.</li>
        <li>Did not have all the necessary headers that VS Code adds automatically after clicking "! enter", so I copied and pasted them over from this page.</li>
        <li>The table did not have a closing tag, so I added /table after all the cells.</li>
        <li>The image link did not go to the right place, since the image is in the img folder, not the same folder as the htmls. So, I corrected the link path.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <h3>We are told there are 3 errors with code and 1 logic error</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>There was an empty bold tag around "New Beehive Inn", with the first "b", but no closing "/b" just empty brackets, so I added the /b.</li>
        <li>The apostraphes were being confused with ASCII character U+0060, so I rewrote them in the VS Code's font.</li>
        <li>The headings jump from h1 being "New Bradford Inn" to immediately h3 being "Description", so I changed that to an h2.</li>
        <li>"Histroy" heading was an h6 without a closing tag instead of an h2, so I changed it to h2 and added a closing tag.</li>
        <li>"Closure" heading was an h3 instead of an h2, so I changed it to h2 since all subsections should be the same type of heading.</li>
        <li>Heading "Interior" was inside bolded tags and an h2 when on the source page it is clearly an h3, but tags cannot be a child of b, so I got rid of the bold tags and changed it to an h3.</li>
        <li>Instead of a link, there is a "where do i go" under Interior, so I checked the source page and added the actual link from that page to page2.html.</li>
        <li>There was also a "broken link" under Description, so I went to the source and re-copied and pasted the correct link.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <h3>We are told there are 2 errors with code and 1 logic error</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Added everything comment said to add: title, meta, and a link to a css stylesheet.</li>
        <li>No DOCTYPE, so I added that at the very top of the document.</li>
        <li>The footer was covering up the contact section, so I went to the css document and changed the position from "absolute" to "fixed"</li>

    </ul>

    
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <h3>We are told there are 3 errors with code and 1 logic error</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>One image only in an "img" tag, and not also nested in a "td" tag, so I added it around the image tags.</li>
        <li>One image did not have the beginning "td" tag, just the closing one, so I added the beginning tag.</li>
        <li>One image did not have the closing "/td" tag, just the beginning one, so I added the end tag.</li>
        <li>The pictures did not follow the headers for the table. (example: dogs were all in the first row, but the dogs header was for the first column). So, because I know how to move the images more than the table headers, I switched the images around to match what the headers said.</li>
        <li>There was no DOCTYPE at the top of the document, so I added it and made sure it included all the same attributes as my page5.html's top does.</li>
        <li>No images had an "atl" attribute, so I added it to all the links and named it after the pictures' names.</li>
    </ul>
